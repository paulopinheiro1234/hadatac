   # For selenium tests to work a user needs Google Chrome and the appropriate
   # chrome web driver for their system. Your system's chrome version is shown
   # here:
   #    chrome://settings/help

   # and web drivers can be downloaded here:
   #    https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

   # To enable selenium tests uncomment the block below and set the values as follows:
   #    web_driver_path- is the path to your chrome driver
   #    user_name- the desired username used for the tests
   #    user_password- the desired password used for the tests
   #    sign_up- a bool that if true will create a new admin user with
   #    the provided user_name and user_password and then begin the testing

       description="Established in 2019, the goal of the HHEAR program is to promote the characterization of the totality of human environmental exposures called the exposome. The exposome includes chemical, physical, and biological stressors as well as lifestyle and social environments. Researchers will harmonize data to gain a better understanding of complicated interactions between environmental factors as determinants of health. HHEAR is a consortium that enables NIH-funded researchers to measure environmental exposures and integrate their data with other datasets by providing access to laboratory, statistical, and data science analysis services."
